# Contributing to SWYF Virtual Try-On

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the SWYF Virtual Try-On project! Since this project has just started (April 2025), we're actively looking for contributors to help shape its direction and features.

## Project Status

The project is in **early development** stage. Many features are still being implemented, and the codebase is rapidly evolving. This is an excellent time to get involved as your contributions can have a significant impact on the project's foundation.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Since we're in the early stages, bug reports are extremely valuable. To report a bug:

1. Check if the bug has already been reported in the Issues section
2. If not, create a new issue with a clear title and description
3. Include steps to reproduce the bug
4. Add screenshots if applicable
5. Mention your operating system, browser, and any relevant environment details

### Suggesting Features

Have an idea for a new feature? We'd love to hear it:

1. Check if the feature has already been suggested in the Issues section
2. If not, create a new issue with the tag "Feature Request"
3. Clearly describe the feature and its potential benefits
4. If possible, outline how it might be implemented

### Code Contributions

We welcome code contributions through pull requests:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix
3. Write your code following our coding standards
4. Add tests if applicable
5. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

See the README.md file for detailed instructions on setting up the development environment.

## Coding Standards

As a new project, our coding standards are still evolving, but we follow these general principles:

### React Frontend

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow functional component patterns with hooks
- Use the Context API for state management where appropriate
- Follow the component structure established in the codebase
- Document your components with JSDoc comments

### Flask Backend

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Document functions and classes with docstrings
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Keep API endpoints RESTful

## Current Focus Areas

We are particularly looking for help with:

- Optimizing the Spline 3D background performance
- Improving image loading and error handling
- Enhancing dark mode support and accessibility
- Implementing the virtual try-on core functionality
- Building out the blockchain integration

## Communication

Since we're just getting started, direct communication through issues and pull requests is the best way to get in touch. In the future, we plan to establish more formal communication channels.

## Code of Conduct

We're committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment. Please treat all contributors with respect and kindness.
